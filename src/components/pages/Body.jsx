            <p>
                Boost your brand recognition with each click. Generic links donâ€™t 
                mean a thing. Branded links help instil confidence in your content.

            <h3>Detailed Records</h3>

            <p>
                Gain insights into who is clicking your links. Knowing when and where 
                people engage with your content helps inform better decisions.
            </p>

            <h3>Fully Customizable</h3>

            <p>
                Improve brand awareness and content discoverability through customizable 
                links, supercharging audience engagement.
